Smoke v0.0.2

A reinterpretation of the Code Igniter 2.0.2 framework

Note: this is based entirely off the Code Igniter 2.0.2 framework.
Even the Smoke.class.php file is just a hacked apart and reorganzied version
of the bootstrapper index.php + system/core/CodeIgniter.php

Kudos to those guys!

Code Igniter is great, but it doesn't fit every situation.  CI is overkill for sites that only need to be one simple form, and can't be used on pre-existing sites.  For these situations, you don't need Code Igniter.  

You just need Smoke.

---

Design Goals:

Allow usage of Code Igniter libraries and helpers outside of the context of a Code Igniter controller without any modifications to the core classes, libraries, or helpers.

---

What you can do:  
* You can load (almost) any Code Igniter library and use it in your code right away.
* You can load any Code Igniter helper and use it in your code right away.

---

At any time you can access Smoke like this: smoke()->foo

Only one instance is ever created and that instance is returned by calling smoke()
(This means you don't call 'new Smoke' ever, just call smoke() whenver you need to use it)

To use smoke in a string, you need to use $smoke.  This is a global variable, and is set the first time you
call smoke()

Then use it like this: echo "<h2>Calendar</h2>$smoke->calendar->generate()";

---

Now Libraries will be auto-loaded when you try to use them. 

If you call smoke()->calendar->generate(), it will just work
You don't have to call smoke()->load->library('calendar') anymore (but you can if you want)

---

There are several global functions Smoke / Code Igniter provides that are useful:

log_message($level = 'error', $message, $php_error = FALSE)
show_error($message, $status_code = 500, $heading = 'An Error Was Encountered')

There are more defined in resources/core/Common.php

---

Here is a quick demo of typical usage:

require_once('Smoke.class.php');

// This is not necessary since libraries are auto loaded
// smoke()->load->library('calendar');

$out = <<< HTML
<p>
	<h2>This Month</h2> 
	{$smoke->calendar->generate()}
</p>

smoke()->out($out);
smoke()->display();

See the examples/ folder for more information.

Now I will explain what it can't do.  Using functions related to these things may not work as expected.  I will eventually remove all of these things.

Caching - Smarty has better caching anyway
Routing - You get to route it yourself!
Hooks - I will remove all of this to make it leaner
Controllers - I may get these working someday
Subclassing/User prefixes/Separation of System VS Application files - Removed to make it leaner

Models should work right but they are untested

Anything else should be working, so send me an email if anything doesn't!
